# Trees

In this Lecture, weâ€™ll be covering Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and K-ary Trees. We will review some common terminology that is shared amongst all of the trees and then dive into specifics of the different types.

# Common Terminology

`Node` - A Tree node is a component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes.

`Root` - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
`K` - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.

`Left` - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree.

`Right` - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree.

`Edge` - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node.

`Leaf` - A leaf is a node that does not have any children.

`Height` - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf.
